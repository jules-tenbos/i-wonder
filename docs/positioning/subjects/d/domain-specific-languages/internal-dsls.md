# Internal DSLs

An internal DSL (also called an embedded DSL) is a domain-specific language built inside a host language. It uses the host's syntax, parser, and tooling, but arranges them so that the resulting code reads as domain-specific rather than general-purpose. The DSL does not have its own grammar — its grammar is the host language's grammar, with strategic choices about which features to exploit and which to suppress.

The term was popularised by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InternalDslStyle.html), though the practice is older. Lisp's macro system has been used to build embedded languages since the 1960s, and the Ruby community's embrace of internal DSLs in the 2000s brought the approach to wide attention.

## Techniques

Several host-language features lend themselves to internal DSL construction. Most internal DSLs combine more than one.

**Method chaining and fluent interfaces.** A sequence of method calls that reads as a declarative statement. Each method returns an object that supports the next call in the chain, producing code that flows as a sentence rather than a series of isolated commands.

```java
// jOOQ — type-safe SQL in Java
create.select(BOOK.TITLE, AUTHOR.NAME)
      .from(BOOK)
      .join(AUTHOR).on(BOOK.AUTHOR_ID.eq(AUTHOR.ID))
      .where(BOOK.YEAR.gt(2000))
      .orderBy(BOOK.TITLE)
```

**Operator overloading.** Redefining operators to carry domain meaning. Scala and Kotlin use this extensively — a `+` on a path object means concatenation, a `|` on a parser combinator means alternation. The operators look like built-in syntax but are defined by the DSL.

**Blocks and closures.** Passing a block of code as an argument, where the block's contents define domain structure. Ruby's block syntax makes this particularly natural — the braces or `do`/`end` delimiters create a visual boundary that separates DSL code from surrounding host code.

```ruby
# RSpec — test specification in Ruby
describe Calculator do
  it "adds two numbers" do
    expect(Calculator.new.add(2, 3)).to eq(5)
  end
end
```

**Monadic embedding.** In Haskell, monads provide a way to sequence domain-specific operations while preserving the host language's type safety and composability. The `do` notation makes monadic code read as a sequence of imperative steps, even though the underlying structure is purely functional.

```haskell
-- Parsec — parser combinators in Haskell
csvFile :: Parser [[String]]
csvFile = do
  lines <- sepEndBy csvLine eol
  eof
  return lines
```

**Meta-programming and macros.** Lisp's macro system transforms code at compile time, allowing the programmer to extend the language's syntax. Clojure, Elixir, and Rust all provide macro facilities used for DSL construction. The macro rewrites domain-specific surface syntax into host-language code before execution.

## Trade-offs

An internal DSL inherits the host language's ecosystem. IDE support, debuggers, profilers, package managers, and the existing community all come for free. The DSL's code is host-language code — it can be tested, versioned, and deployed with the same tools.

The cost is syntactic constraint. The DSL's grammar is the host's grammar. If the domain calls for syntax that the host cannot express — infix operators in a language without operator overloading, significant whitespace in a language that ignores it — the internal approach hits a wall. The resulting code may read well enough to a developer familiar with the host, but it remains host-language code wearing a domain costume, and some domains resist the disguise.

Error messages can be a friction point. When a user makes a mistake in an internal DSL, the error comes from the host language's compiler or runtime, phrased in the host language's terms. A missing comma in a jOOQ chain produces a Java compile error, not a SQL error. The gap between the domain the user is thinking in and the language the error is phrased in can be disorienting.

## Examples

- **[RSpec](https://rspec.info/)** (Ruby) — test specification. Blocks and method chaining produce code that reads as natural-language test descriptions.
- **[ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html)** (Ruby) — database querying. Method chaining constructs queries that map to SQL without requiring the user to write SQL directly.
- **[jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/)** (Java/Kotlin) — type-safe SQL. Fluent interface over the full SQL standard, with compile-time type checking against the database schema.
- **[Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html)** (Kotlin) — build configuration. Lambda-with-receiver syntax allows build scripts to read as declarative configuration while retaining full Kotlin expressiveness.
- **[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)** (Scala) — build configuration. Operator overloading and Scala's flexible syntax create a build-definition language that sits inside Scala.
- **[Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec)** (Haskell) — parser combinators. Monadic embedding allows parsers to be composed from smaller parsers using standard Haskell operators.
- **[QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck)** (Haskell) — property-based testing. Properties are expressed as Haskell functions; the framework generates test cases automatically.

## Host languages well-suited to internal DSLs

Not every language makes a good DSL host. The features that matter most are syntactic flexibility and the ability to suppress boilerplate so that domain-level intent is visible.

**Ruby** — flexible block syntax, optional parentheses, method_missing for dynamic dispatch. The language that brought internal DSLs to mainstream attention through Rails, RSpec, and Rake.

**Scala** — operator overloading, implicit conversions, flexible method-call syntax, and macros. Widely used for type-safe embedded DSLs in data processing (Spark) and build tools (sbt).

**Kotlin** — lambda-with-receiver, extension functions, operator overloading. Designed with DSL construction as an explicit goal; the [type-safe builders](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html) documentation is part of the language's official guidance.

**Haskell** — type classes, monadic do-notation, and a powerful type system that allows DSLs to be both expressive and statically checked. The academic home of embedded DSL research.

**Clojure and Lisp** — homoiconicity (code is data) and macro systems that allow compile-time code transformation. The oldest tradition of language-building-inside-a-language.

**Groovy** — closures, operator overloading, and meta-object protocol. The original language of Gradle and a common choice for configuration DSLs in the Java ecosystem.
