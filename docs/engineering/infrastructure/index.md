# Infrastructure

The Infrastructure layer is the software the SPLectrum Platform is built on. This section documents that stack as a reference: what each piece is, where it lives upstream, and how the parts fit together.

## Holepunch
- [Bare](bare/) — the minimal JavaScript runtime the stack targets, its module ecosystem, and how you port code to it.
- [P2P building blocks](p2p/) — the Hypercore family plus the networking, crypto, and availability layers. Usable directly, independent of Pear.
- [Pear](pear/) — the peer-to-peer application runtime and deployment platform, now an embeddable library.

## In House

- [bare-for-pear](bare-for-pear/) — modules we adapted to run on Bare, and what we learned doing it.
- [pear-full-square](pear-full-square/) — our proof-of-concept repositories.

## Wider P2P & Pear Ecosystem

**Flagship:** [Keet](https://keet.io/) — Holepunch's P2P chat, the marquee app built on the stack.

- [Browse the ecosystem](ecosystem/) — projects built on the stack, graded established / active / further.
