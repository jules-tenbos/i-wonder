# Engineering Commitments

Commitments taken before the architecture is reached — they explain why it has the shape it does. Components wrapped in from outside (substrate, infrastructure) retain their own design integrity.

**Data first.** For everything in the system, data state is authoritative. Processes act on data state and derive from it — they are not independent of it. Hence the *data X* vocabulary family — data state, data entity, data owner, data world.

**No hidden state.** Whatever exists in the system is visible in some owner's data world view. Nothing lurks behind interfaces. Known by its imprint on the fabric, not by looking inside.

**Functionality as metadata.** Functionality is colocated as metadata on the data. Protocols, schemas, and operational logic live in the data state alongside the data they act on — not behind separate APIs or in external configuration.

**Human-AI collaboration.** Human and AI as collaborative peers, no central controller. Activity is organised accordingly.

**Logical over physical.** Architecture describes how a system must look, not how it must be physically built. The separation is strategic: physical implementation is the natural place for AI to take maximal autonomy, advancing the human-AI collaboration.

**Decentralisation is constitutive.** Solutions are built within a private context. Decentralisation is not an afterthought — no central database, no single source of truth, no central controller.
