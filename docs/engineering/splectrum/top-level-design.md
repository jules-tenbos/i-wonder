# SPLectrum Engineering — Top Level Design

The three pillars of the SPLectrum platform — repository, language, process — and the reason each is named what it is. Mycelium is the substrate; the others embed into it.

---

## Three Pillars

The platform addresses three distinct concerns:

- **Repository** — where data state lives.
- **Language** — what data state means.
- **Process** — how data state changes and is acted on.

Each is its own fabric. The repository fabric is the substrate; the language and process fabrics are embedded into it as metadata.

## Repository Fabric — Mycelium

A mycelium is a network of fungal threads underground — vast, interconnected, decentralised. What is visible above ground (mushrooms) are local expressions of an interconnected whole.

The repository fabric works the same way. Each owner has their own data state, organised as a local tree of data nodes. The fabric is what connects these local trees: references that address nodes across repositories, and data state propagation that carries change between owners. Decentralised at the data level: no central database, no single source of truth.

Within a local tree, processes are invoked on nodes. Data visibility extends from a node to itself and its descendants; metadata resolution walks up to itself and its ancestors. XPath addresses nodes, used as URL or query.

## Language Fabric — SPLectrum

The pillar takes the project's name. Language is the project's central concern — from the seed, all relating is language. The platform centred on this principle adopts the project name for its language fabric.

SPLectrum supplies the protocols — relational patterns that act on data state. Each protocol is a software API with meaning constraint; operators are its methods; personas are compositions of protocols that take on roles. Protocols and personas are colocated as metadata with the data nodes they act on, in mycelium.

## Process Fabric — HAICC

HAICC stands for Human-AI Creative Collaboration. The pillar takes this name because the process fabric is where humans and AI collaborate as peers — no central controller, work divided by capability conformance.

The fabric holds process definitions, watcher expressions, readiness schemas. Processes trigger on data state change. Personas declare what is needed; conformance against available human and AI capabilities determines the division of work. Process definitions are colocated as metadata with the data nodes they act on, in mycelium.
