# Page structure — persons and subjects

Standard structure for positioning person and subject pages. Use these as templates when creating new pages.

This doc covers structure only. The voice discipline these pages follow — outside voice, no SPLectrum vocabulary or seed references anywhere on a person or subject page — lives in `tone-of-voice/positioning-section.md`, which is authoritative where the two overlap.

## Person page

1. **Front matter**: title as "Firstname Lastname (born–died)", description, layout
2. **Breadcrumb**: Home > Positioning > Persons > Name
3. **Heading**: full name with dates
4. **Intro paragraph**: what the thinker did and why it matters, in their own terms. Let the thinker speak first — no seed connection, no quiet pointer, no SPLectrum vocabulary, no P-tags. Report the work, don't adjudicate it ("argued", "developed an account of", not "established", "proved"). Internal links to other persons and related subjects
5. **Biographical paragraph**: external SEP link, life and career, one paragraph
6. **Key concepts**: bold term + explanation, one paragraph each. Outside voice — no seed references
7. **Closing sections** ("where X stops"): synthesis work, not lifted from research — name what the thinker's own framework leaves unaddressed and the boundary that draws. Frame it as the thinker's own boundaries, not as the gap with SPLectrum. Deficit-naming ("X didn't reach Y"), not recharacterisation ("what X reached is less than it appears"). No P-tags, no seed vocabulary; keep it compact
8. **Key works**: list with Wikipedia links, at the end before See also
9. **See also**: primarily within-positioning interlinking — related persons and subjects. SPLectrum-side links (seed, resonance-ring pieces, fence, blog) only as a clearly distinct sub-block, or omitted

## Subject page

The whole page is outside voice — the subject on its own terms, in full breadth, with no SPLectrum vocabulary or seed references anywhere. No "why this matters to SPLectrum" framing; the subject's significance is stated within its own field.

1. **Front matter**: title (with abbreviation if applicable), description, layout
2. **Breadcrumb**: Home > Positioning > Subjects > Name
3. **Heading**: full name with abbreviation
4. **Intro paragraph**: what the subject is and why it matters in its own field, with internal links to persons and related subjects
5. **Origin section**: where the concept comes from — the field it belongs to, but also where the pattern resonates beyond that field
6. **Core sections**: the substance — what the concept is, how it works, key distinctions, its internal conflicts and contested receptions. Internal links to persons and other subjects where relevant
7. **Meaning section**: what makes the concept more than technical — the semantic or philosophical weight of its constructs, framed within the subject's own field
8. **Persons**: key figures associated with the subject, with links (Wikipedia for external, internal for persons with pages)
9. **See also**: primarily within-positioning interlinking — related subjects and the persons who carry them. SPLectrum-side links (resonance-ring pieces, fence, blog) only as a clearly distinct sub-block, or omitted

## Index pages

Both persons and subjects have an A–Z index page.

- **Persons**: Surname, Firstname (born–died) link · person type `<br>` keywords
- **Subjects**: Name (abbreviation) link · field `<br>` keywords
- Entries within a letter section get `li + li` spacing (handled by CSS)
- New entries are inserted in their correct alphabetical position, not prepended. A new person or subject page does not exist for readers until it is linked from its A–Z index.

## Predecessors and provenance

When a person page's central contribution built on, generalised, or reacted to an identifiable predecessor's work, name the predecessor — even if the predecessor does not yet have their own page. The page's instinct is to start the story at the named figure; full-breadth honesty usually wants it started one step earlier. Examples: Boveri-Sutton before Morgan's chromosome proof; Wiesner before Bennett's BB84; Robertson before Price's covariance equation; Anscombe's "Modern Moral Philosophy" before Foot's virtue ethics; Mayr's population thinking before Ghiselin's species-as-individuals.

This is not a requirement to trace every intellectual lineage to its origin — touchstone over comprehensive still applies. Name the predecessor when the contribution is a proof, formalisation, development, or naming of something already in the air; omit when the contribution is genuinely novel.

## General

- Descriptions go in front matter on every page
- `lastmod` goes in front matter on creation (today's date) and is bumped on edit — both sitemaps auto-generate from it
- Internal links preferred over external; external links (SEP, Wikipedia) on the person/subject page itself, not scattered through posts
- Key works get Wikipedia links
- The page title in front matter matches the `# heading` on the page
